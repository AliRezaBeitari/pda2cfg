## Convert PDA to CFG
This is my second project for my course (*An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata*) which can convert a **PDA** (Pushdown automata) to **CFG** (Context-free grammar).

I used **PyQt5** for making the GUI and **graphviz** for generating the graphs.

The main algorithm that convert PDA to CFG is located in **pda.py** file.
